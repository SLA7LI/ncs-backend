## About

SALA7LI is more than a marketplace, it's a  system that transforms how people request and deliver home and on-site services. Instead of fixed listings and static prices, we let every service request become a negotiation space ("lobby") where workers can bid and clients stay in control and in the end accept who will continiue with.



## Features

## ‚Ä¢ Worker Browsing & Filtering  
Clients can easily browse available workers and apply filters based on service category, location, and availability.

## ‚Ä¢ Smart Service Request Creation  
Clients can describe their problems using a simple form ‚Äî or use our intelligent assistant (chatbot) to complete the process conversationally.

## ‚Ä¢ Bidding-Based Negotiation (Lobby System)  
Each service request becomes a negotiation space ("lobby") where selected workers place bids on the job. The client stays in full control of whom to hire.

## ‚Ä¢ Automatic Worker Invitation  
Upon submitting a request, the system automatically invites 3‚Äì10 relevant workers based on urgency, category, and proximity using a recommendation system.

## ‚Ä¢ Urgency-Aware Pricing  
Urgent requests can trigger higher starting prices or slightly increased platform fees to prioritize faster service.

## ‚Ä¢ Service Demand Heatmaps  
A visual heatmap highlights high-demand areas by location and service category, helping bring more workers.

## ‚Ä¢ Mutual Deposit System  
Both the client and the worker submit a small deposit to confirm their seriousness. Once the job is mutually confirmed as completed, the deposit is transferred to the worker (minus platform fees).

## ‚Ä¢ Worker Verification  
Workers are required to submit official documents (e.g., commercial registration) to unlock full access to job opportunities, enhancing platform trust.

## ‚Ä¢ AI-Powered Chatbot Assistant  
A built-in chatbot helps users navigate the platform, fill out forms, ask questions, and take action quickly.

## ‚Ä¢ Performance & Activity Tracking  
Workers‚Äô profiles include statistics such as number of bids joined, job completion rates, client feedback, and response handling performance.

## ‚Ä¢ Dynamic Worker Resume Building  
The system helps workers build strong digital resumes by showcasing past lobbies, completed jobs, ratings, and history with clients.
