## About

SALA7LI is more than a marketplace, it's a  system that transforms how people request and deliver home and on-site services. Instead of fixed listings and static prices, we let every service request become a negotiation space ("lobby") where workers can bid and clients stay in control and in the end accept who will continiue with.



## Features
- Clients can browse workers or filter based on category, location, and availability.
- Clients can also describe their problem through a form to create a bidding lobby. Or by using our smart assisstant to do the same operation.
- Every request becomes a negotiation space (lobby) where invited workers can bid on the price of the work.
- When a form is submitted, the system automatically invites 3‚Äì10 recommended workers (based on urgency).
- Urgant requests may have a slightly higher starting price or platform fee.
- Shows areas with high service demand based on category and location using heatmaps.
- Both client and worker send a small deposit to confirm seriousness, and after mutual confirmation that work is done, the deposit is transferred to the worker (minus platform fee).
- Workers must submit official documents like a commercial registration to access jobs.
- Chatbot helps users understand the platform and take actions like filling service request forms.
- Track number of bids joined,client handling, success rate, feedback.
- Our system help workers imrpove theirr resume by howcasing old client lobbies that were created and finished.
