## About

SALA7LI is more than a marketplace, it's a  system that transforms how people request and deliver home and on-site services. Instead of fixed listings and static prices, we let every service request become a negotiation space ("lobby") where workers can bid and clients stay in control and in the end accept who will continiue with.



## Features
### ‚Ä¢ Worker Browsing & Filtering
Clients can browse available service providers and apply filters based on:
- Service category  
- Geographic location  
- Availability  

### ‚Ä¢ Smart Service Request Creation
Clients can:
- Describe their service need through a simple form  
- Or use our AI-powered chatbot assistant to fill out the request conversationally  

### ‚Ä¢ Bidding-Based Negotiation (Lobby System)
Each request becomes a **lobby**, a negotiation space where:
- Invited workers bid with their prices  
- Clients stay in control and choose the worker that fits best  

### ‚Ä¢ Automatic Worker Invitation
Once a request is submitted:
- The system invites **3‚Äì10 workers** automatically  
- Selection is based on urgency, category, and proximity using a recommendation system  

### ‚Ä¢ Urgency-Aware Pricing
- Urgent service requests can trigger higher initial prices  
- A slightly higher platform fee may apply to prioritize faster responses  

### ‚Ä¢ Service Demand Heatmaps
- Real-time heatmaps display **high-demand areas** by location and service type  
- Helps attract more workers to areas with client needs  

### ‚Ä¢ Mutual Deposit System
- Both the client and the worker submit a small **deposit** to confirm commitment  
- After mutual job confirmation, the deposit is released to the worker (minus platform fees)  

### ‚Ä¢ Worker Verification
- Workers must upload **official documents** (e.g., commercial registration)  
- Unlocks full access to job opportunities and increases trust  

### ‚Ä¢ AI-Powered Chatbot Assistant
- Users are guided through the platform by a built-in chatbot  
- Supports service request creation, FAQs, and platform actions  

### ‚Ä¢ Performance & Activity Tracking
- Worker profiles include detailed analytics:
  - Number of bids participated in  
  - Job success rates  
  - Feedback and handling performance  

### ‚Ä¢ Dynamic Worker Resume Building
- Workers can showcase:
  - Completed jobs  
  - Previous client lobbies  
  - Ratings and history  
- Builds a powerful digital reputation on the platform
